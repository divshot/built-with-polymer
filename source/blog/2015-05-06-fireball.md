[Fireball](http://fireball-x.com/en) is an editor framework for mobile and HTML5 game development. We focus on creating the most accessible and feature reach GUI toolset in one single editor with HTML and JavaScript.

On the runtime side, Fireball uses other popular open sourced game engines such as [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) and [Cocos2D-JS](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-html5). This makes Fireball really easy to get into for game engine users. Users will keep the benefit of all the existing apis, packing and optimization from other game engines. And a lot more can be achieved with a better editor.
